[Definition]

# Fre-filter via "prefregex" is currently inactive because of too different failure syntax in exim-log (testing needed):
#prefregex = ^%(pid)s <F-CONTENT>\b(?:\w+ authenticator failed|([\w\-]+ )?SMTP (?:(?:call|connection) from|protocol(?: synchronization)? error)|no MAIL in|(?:%(host_info_pre)s\[[^\]]+\]%(host_info_suf)s(?:sender verify fail|rejected RCPT|dropped|AUTH command))).+</F-CONTENT>$

failregex = ^%(pid)s \S+ .*%(host_info)s.*\<spameri@tiscali.it\>.*$
             # spambots trying to forward emails to addresses not used anymore:
             ^%(pid)s \S+ .*%(host_info)s.* from .* for (princeamd|thanatermesis|thanatermesisf|samuel|reply|admin)@elivecd.org$
            #<mdre-<mode>>

#mdre-aggressive = ^%(pid)s no host name found for IP address <HOST>$
                  #^%(pid)s no IP address found for host \S+ \(during SMTP connection from \[<HOST>\]\)$

#mdre-normal = 

# Parameter `mode` - `normal` or `aggressive`.
# Aggressive mode can be used to match flood and ddos-similar log-entries like:
#   'no host found for IP', 'no IP found for host'.
# Note this is not an authentication failures, so it may produce lots of false 
# positives on misconfigured MTAs.
# Ex.:
#   filter = exim[mode=aggressive]
mode = normal

ignoreregex = 

# DEV Notes:
# The %(host_info) defination contains a <HOST> match
#
# SMTP protocol synchronization error \([^)]*\)  <- This needs to be non-greedy
# to void capture beyond ")" to avoid a DoS Injection vulnerabilty as input= is
# user injectable data.
