## Collaboration:
You are welcome to send push commits for fixes and improvements, especially dynamic compatibility, but to change the behaviour of the tool will require a previous debate / brainstorm since some things can break if done differently, since there's many different operating systems (and so different way to set up things, file locations, compatibilities, versions, etc...) is sometimes better to just stick to a debian base which we know it works good and is made for it.
